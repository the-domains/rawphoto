The Mines of São Domingos are located in the Alentejo - Portugal, in the Council of Mértola, very close to Spain. The mine and the respective village relate to an old mining town.

This is a beautiful location for its industrial landscape and history. It was presented to me by a colleague and friend, Daniel Oliveira (Geologist). These are some of the few photographs I took on a very hot summer afternoon and with a very strong light, not being the ideal hour for shooting.

This place deserves to be visited again and photographed with a more appropriate light and in more detail, reason why this can be considered a preliminary post about it.
