On a Saturday afternoon I entered this completely empty and enormous room. I was at a christening party for some friends' children. It was not being occupied by the party. With some surprise, when I entered rapidly saw the environment that was created, with only natural light and blackouts that caused a very beautiful diffusion in the natural sun light.

The room was semi-square, with only two doors and two windows. The windows (also enormous) were at the opposite side of one of the doors (the door I entered), the other door, was located at the right side of the windows (when you have the perspective through the door I entered).

Obviously, because of the party context in which I found myself, I was already walking with the camera in my hand (my little Sony a6300 with the 20mm Sony lens), and when I saw the beautiful atmosphere that the room had, rapidly began to change the camera setup to experiment what I could do.

Shortly after, some of the children came in, including my son, my nephew, and the daughter of some friends of ours. These are the three kids you can see in the photos above.

What I managed to got and wanted to, were photographs with a little silhouette in the backlight (of course that was the most obvious thing to do), but at the same time I managed to make the photos capture the rest of the environment that existed in the room at that hour of the day, when the sun was already relatively low and trying to enter the room.

The result is very beautiful and can show really the "ambience". Obviously for this result also contributed the extreme patience of my son, my nephew, but especially of the daughter of my friends, who was a fantastic to model with the patience of a professional one. She's so photogenic!
