Parallel to what is the previous post about the Marbles of Alentejo, in here I had the opportunity to photograph not only quarries, but also some other details already in the processing stage of the stone (Processing Plant).

However, this post is also distinguished from the previous one because this type of stone is not a marble, but a limestone.

In Portugal the limestone zone is located in the western part of the country above Lisbon. The area where you can extract this type of stone is called Serra de Aires e Candeeiros. A wonderful area not only for its landscapes, proximity to the sea but also by the harmonious way this industrial sector is integrated and relates to the strong environmental component of this area that is not only a Natural Park, but also part of the Natura2000 Europe Network.

In the photos you can see not only the quarries and blocks, but also some of the processing stage (in a Processing Plant), with photos of finished product, details of a fossil on the processed slab and wastes that result from the processing.

Many thanks to SOLANCIS!
