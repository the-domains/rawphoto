# Dubai landscapes

With very difficult conditions because of the interior lights reflecting on the windows of Burj Khalifa's top floor (the visitable one), and a very limited line of sight due to the sand on the air i was able to catch this landscapes.

Almost 2 hours, but worth all the time spent up there (about 928 meters high).

It was an experience!
