The history of the Alentejo marbles is not just the story of a stone. It's the history of men, their lives and of a culture of wresting stone from the bowels of the earth to achieve an unrivaled raw material.  
The work associated with the exploitation of this stone causes a magnificent change in the landscape. The conditions of the deposit of this resource means that its exploitation must be done in a "well", making this landscape almost unique. It is an industrial landscape, with a strong connection to nature, showing almost the negative of the images of the buildings for which this material was used.
