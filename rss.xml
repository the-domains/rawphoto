            <title><![CDATA[The Art of Photography]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>The Art of Photography</h1>,<p>I started shooting (more often), roughly between 2005 and 2006, and like all recent parents when my first child was born, I bought a new camera to try to record, as best I could and know all the new moments we were experiencing, here at home.</p>,<p>But, I already liked photography. At that time the “new reason” (… calling my child the new reason…), made me buy new equipment, and begin to develop a very particular taste for photography, as a hobby of course.</p>,<p>Obviously, at that same time, for the reasons explained before, the focus of my attention was the family, my recent son and my wife. However, over time, the subjects have diversified and the taste for trying to photograph new things only made “the thing” grow. At the same time, I had the need and also the curiosity to have to know more about photography, because I was feeling that what I was able to do was not enough.</p>,<p>I was developing my daily work on a very industrial sector, the mineral resources (more specifically the Natural Stones) and that was a really different subject to photograph and a real challenge for me. This fact, the will to face the challenge and because my background is engineering (I had nothing to do with the creative arts) has increased the need for more knowledge about photography and the search for it. And on that search I found <a href="http://tedforbes.com/" title="">Ted Forbes</a> and it’s The Art of Photography.</p>,<p>The <a href="http://theartofphotography.tv/" title="">Art of Photography</a> as Ted refers in the website as started “<em>(…) as a podcast in 2008 and the show has since grown into a popular YouTube channel and resource website providing a 360° view of photography to a global audience.</em>”</p>,<p>And this is really a true and a very simple and beautiful way to describe it, because since the early beginning the Podcast showed huge differences from the others that I was following. Already in video format with very interesting episodes that varied between technical questions on how to understand the cameras, lenses, aperture, related issues to film photography, it’s development in a dark room (this was at a time when digital photography had already completely conquered the market), but mostly, because it also “<em>interweaves</em>” these more technical “episodes” with the presentation of photographers and some history about photography - which I consider to be phenomenal!</p>,<p><strong>The Artist Series IT’s A MUST!!!</strong></p>,<p>The other thing that i need to underline about Ted is the excellence of his interaction with the audience of The Art Of Photography. There is nothing comparable.</p>,<p><strong>A great part of what I know at the moment (techniques, equipment, photographers and photographs) was through The Art of Photography. Thank you very much!</strong></p>,<p>Please follow the link below to The Art of Photography website, it’s a joy!</p>,<article><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d943e8b3d4e560038a6adc7a7c073394e5ae1ba4.jpg"><h1>The Art of Photography Podcast</h1><p>The Art of Photography provides a 360&deg; view of photography with a podcast, video tutorials, articles and resources.</p></article>,<p>But Ted Forbes is also a photographer, filmmaker and musician, so I could not miss the opportunity to also point the link below to the website where you can see fabulous photos, movies and some of his music.</p>,<article><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4e0af01d946b417257379010599cdc12f0bdd4b2.jpg"><h1>Home | Ted Forbes</h1><p>Ted Forbes Website</p></article>,<p><strong>My sincere thanks to Ted Forbes for the excellent content you produce and for having taken the initiative to share with us. THANKS!</strong></p>,<p>I hope you all like it and enjoy it!</p>,<p>…Sharing from, and to others…</p>,<p>Cheers,</p>,<p>(sorry my english…)</p>]]></description>
